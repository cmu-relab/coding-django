	<div id="text0"><p>A few final words on deletion: We can't guarantee that <span class="coded_i" alt="messages">messages</span> will be deleted within a specific timeframe. And even after we've deleted <span class="coded_i" alt="message">message</span> <span class="coded_i" alt="data">data</span> from our servers, that same data may remain in backup for a limited period of time. We also sometimes receive requests from law enforcement requiring us by law to suspend our ordinary server-deletion practices for specific <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span>. Finally, of course, as with any <span class="coded_i" alt="digital information">digital information</span>, there may be ways to access <span class="coded_i" alt="messages">messages</span> while still in temporary storage on recipients' devices or, forensically, even after they are deleted. We may let other companies use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies on Snapchat.</p></div>
	<div id="text1"><p>Additionally, some companies may use the <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> they collect on our blog and other websites to deliver targeted advertisements on behalf of us or other companies, including on third-party websites and apps. Snapchat does not currently respond to do-not-track signals that may be sent from your device. If we do so in the future, we will provide <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about that practice in an updated version of this privacy policy. For more <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about interest-based ads, including how to opt out of having your <span class="coded_i" alt="web browsing information">web browsing information</span> used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visitwww.aboutads.info / choices. We don't direct our Services to anyone under 13. And that's why we do not knowingly collect <span class="coded_i" alt="personal information">personal information</span> from anyone under 13. Children under 13 may only use Snapkidz. For more <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about Snapkidz, please see ConnectSafely's Parents' Guide to Snapchat, available here.</p></div>
	<div id="text2"><p>And again in most cases, the Services are programmed to delete the <span class="coded_i" alt="message">message</span> from the recipients' device as well. There are, however, several exceptions to this general rule: Replay: Users with access to the Replay feature are, as the name suggests, able to replay a Snap additional times before it is deleted from their device. My Story: If you add a Snap to your personal Story, other users will be able to view it for 24 hours. Our Stories: Because Our <span class="coded_i" alt="stories">Stories</span> and other crowd-sourced <span class="coded_i" alt="stories">Stories</span> are inherently public and chronicle matters of public interest, we may archive them and allow them to be viewed again through Snapchat or other sources.</p></div>
	<div id="text3"><p>But we do a lot more as well, such as: Provide and deliver the products, services, and functionality that you request, process transactions, and send you related information; Communicate with you. That means just what it says; we may send you marketing communications on behalf of us or other companies; respond to your comments and questions; provide customer service; and send you technical notices, security alerts, and other informational <span class="coded_i" alt="messages">messages</span>; Monitor and analyze trends and usage; Develop, improve, and refine products, services, and functionality; Personalize the Services by providing advertisements, content, or features that match user profiles or interests. For instance, when you set up an account we may pre-populate certain <span class="coded_i" alt="account information">account information</span> based on the <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> we collect about you from other users; Verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity; and Carry out any other purpose for which the <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> was collected.</p></div>
	<div id="text4"><p>But, and this is important, you should understand that users who see your <span class="coded_i" alt="messages">messages</span> can always save them, either by taking a screenshot or by using some other image-capture technology (whether that be software or even something as old-fashioned as a camera to take a photo of your device's screen). If we're able to detect that a recipient took a screenshot of a <span class="coded_i" alt="message">message</span> you sent, we'll try to notify you. But the same common sense that applies to the Internet at large applies to Snapchat as well: Don't send messages that you wouldn't want someone to save or share. In most cases, once we detect that all recipients have viewed a message, we automatically delete it from our servers.</p></div>
	<div id="text5"><p>By going to those links or by using a co-branded or third-party-branded Service, you may be providing <span class="coded_i" alt="personal information">personal information</span> directly to the third party, us, or both. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span>. As always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party website or service that you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through our Services. Delete is our default. That means that most <span class="coded_i" alt="messages">messages</span> sent through our Services will be automatically deleted once they have been viewed or have expired.</p></div>
	<div id="text6"><p>Chats: The Services are programmed to automatically delete a <span class="coded_i" alt="chat">Chat</span> after you and the recipient have seen it and swiped out of the Chat screen, unless either of you taps to save it. Read this help article for more details about Chats. Snapcash: The Services are programmed to automatically delete a <span class="coded_i" alt="snapcash message">Snapcash message</span> after you and the recipient have seen the message and swiped out of the Chat screen, unless either of you taps to save the message. But in case we ever need to follow up with you about a transaction (for instance, if money is refunded to you), our Services are programmed to retain for up to 10 days <span class="coded_i" alt="recipient,sender">information regarding the recipient and sender</span>, the <span class="coded_i" alt="transaction amount">transaction amount</span>, and <span class="coded_i" alt="various timestamps">various timestamps</span> (for example, the time the message was sent, received, and opened).</p></div>
	<div id="text7"><p><span class="coded_i" alt="cookies">Cookies</span> are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that store <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about your use of the Services, which can, among other things, help us see which areas and features of the Services are popular and let us count visits. Web beacons are small pieces of software on a webpage or <span class="coded_i" alt="email">email</span> that help us see how you interact with that webpage or email. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser <span class="coded_i" alt="cookies">cookies</span>. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting <span class="coded_i" alt="cookies">cookies</span> could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.</p></div>
	<div id="text8"><p><span class="coded_i" alt="device information">Device Information</span>: We collect <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about your device, including the <span class="coded_i" alt="hardware model">hardware model</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="operating system,operating system version">operating system and version</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="unique device identifiers">unique device identifiers</span> (including MAC address and IMEI), <span class="coded_i" alt="browser type">browser type</span> and <span class="coded_i" alt="language">language</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="mobile device phone number">mobile device phone number</span>, and <span class="coded_i" alt="mobile network information">mobile network information</span>. We also collect certain <span class="coded_i" alt="device information">device information</span> that will help us diagnose problems in the (hopefully rare) event you experience any crash or other problem while using our Services. So, for example, if we detect a crash or other problematic event, we may collect the <span class="coded_i" alt="list of apps on your device">list of apps on your device</span> and other <span class="coded_i" alt="information about your device's performance">information about your device's performance</span> at the time of the event for troubleshooting purposes.</p></div>
	<div id="text9"><p>Device <span class="coded_i" alt="phonebook">Phonebook</span> and <span class="coded_i" alt="photos">Photos</span>: Because Snapchat is all about communicating with friends, we may with your consent collect <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> from your device's <span class="coded_i" alt="phonebook">phonebook</span> and <span class="coded_i" alt="photos">photos</span>. We do this so that we can connect you to your friends quickly and intuitively, enhance the Services with additional functionality, and for any other purpose described in this privacy policy. You can always revoke your consent to our ongoing ability to collect <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> from your device's <span class="coded_i" alt="phonebook">phonebook</span> and <span class="coded_i" alt="photos">photos</span> by changing the settings on your device if your device offers that option, or by simply deleting our app from your device (though we hope you'll never do that).</p></div>
	<div id="text10"><p>For additional Services beyond the basic Snapchat account, we may ask you for additional <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span>. In connection with Snapcash, we may collect a <span class="coded_i" alt="debit number,credit card number">debit or credit card number</span> or an <span class="coded_i" alt="image">image</span> of the card, its associated <span class="coded_i" alt="account information">account information</span>, and any other <span class="coded_i" alt="security-related information">security-related information</span>. We want you, though, to be in control of your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span>, so we let you update or correct most of the basic Snapchat account <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> by editing your account settings within Snapchat. For Snapcash, you may delink your payment card information in the Snapcash settings. And while we hope you'll remain a lifelong Snapchatter, if for some reason you ever want to delete your account, just visit this link; but keep in mind that we may retain certain <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law.</p></div>
	<div id="text11"><p>For more <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about how we store and delete the <span class="coded_i" alt="messages">messages</span> you send or receive through Snapchat, please read the Message Deletion section a little farther down. What You Automatically Provide Us When You Use Our Services. Because Snapchat is about sharing moments with people, there is some <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> we collect automatically when you access our Services, which we use to facilitate the broad range of communications offered through our Services, to provide you cool features and functionality, and to enable all the other purposes described in this privacy policy. We explain all this below.</p></div>
	<div id="text12"><p>Here's the type of information we may share about you with others and how we do so: When you send a <span class="coded_i" alt="message">message</span>, your recipients will see your <span class="coded_i" alt="username">username</span> and, of course, whatever your <span class="coded_i" alt="message">message</span> says or shows (whether that's a <span class="coded_i" alt="photo">photo</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="video">video</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="text">text</span>, or <span class="coded_i" alt="transaction">transaction</span>). When you view <span class="coded_i" alt="content">content</span> that another Snapchat user has sent you, we will let the sender know that you saw it, and if we detect that you captured a screenshot of the message, we will try to let the sender know that. But you're always able to tell us whether you'd like to receive Snaps only from users you have added to your friends list or whether you'd prefer to receive Snaps from all Snapchatters.</p></div>
	<div id="text13"><p>If you have any questions about how to do that, click here for some helpful tips. And if you ever want to delete users from your friends list, block specific users, or control who can view your Stories, we let you do that as well through various settings. For more information on how to manage who can send you Snaps, read this helpful article. When you use video chat, the recipient will see your live video and the recipient's device will receive some <span class="coded_i" alt="technical information about your device">technical information about your device</span> to facilitate the connection. You'll learn even more about how to use video chat and manage this feature by checking out this help article.</p></div>
	<div id="text14"><p>Information We Collect When You Contact Us. Whenever you have a question for our helpful Support team, just head over to https: / / support.snapchat.com. Of course, when you contact the Support team or communicate with us in any other way, we'll collect whatever <span class="coded_i" alt="information you volunteer">information you volunteer</span>. For instance, if you submit <span class="coded_i" alt="artwork">artwork</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="files">files</span>, or any other <span class="coded_i" alt="materials">materials</span> to us through our websites, we will collect what you give us. What do we do with the <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> we collect? The short answer is: Provide you with an amazing set of Services that we relentlessly improve.</p></div>
	<div id="text15"><p>Location Information: With your consent, we collect your <span class="coded_i" alt="device location">device location</span> so that you can use our location-based features, such as message filters and Our Stories, and for any other purpose described in this privacy policy. As with your <span class="coded_i" alt="phonebook">phonebook</span> and <span class="coded_i" alt="photos">photos</span>, you can always revoke your consent by changing the settings or preferences on your device. If you do so, certain features of the Services will no longer function. And, of course, you can revoke your consent by deleting Snapchat from your device.Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: Like most online services, we use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies.</p></div>
	<div id="text16"><p>Snapchat is a fast and fun way to share experiences with your friends and the world around you. Users can send a <span class="coded_i" alt="photo">photo</span> or <span class="coded_i" alt="video">video</span> Snap to friends, chronicle their day through My Story posts, touch base using Chat, and immerse themselves in global events through Our Story. This privacy policy describes how we (Snapchat, Inc. and our subsidiaries) collect, use, and share your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> whenever you use our Services. Those Services include every way you might interact with us: through our websites, mobile applications, and any of our other online products and services that link to this privacy policy.</p></div>
	<div id="text17"><p>Snapchat is based in the United States. Although we welcome Snapchatters from all over the world, keep in mind that no matter where you live or where you happen to use our Services, you consent to the processing and transfer of <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> in and to the U.S. and other countries. We want you to know this because the laws of the United States and those of other countries where your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> is processed might not be as comprehensive or protective as laws in the country where you live. And while you're in another country, know that your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> may be made available to government or law enforcement requests.</p></div>
	<div id="text18"><p>These companies may collect <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about how you <span class="coded_i" alt="use">use</span> the Services and other websites and online services over time and across different services. The <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> collected may include <span class="coded_i" alt="unique device identifiers">unique device identifiers</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="device manufacturer,operating system">device manufacturer and operating system</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="ip address">IP address</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="browser type">browser type</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="pages viewed">pages viewed</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="session start time,session stop time">session start/stop time</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="links clicked">links clicked</span>, and <span class="coded_i" alt="conversion information">conversion information</span>.

	<div id="text19"><p>To learn more about how third parties use such technologies on our Services, be sure to read the Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others section of our privacy policy. <span class="coded_i" alt="website log">Website Log</span> Information: We collect <span class="coded_i" alt="log file information">log file information</span> when you use our websites. That <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> includes, among other things, your <span class="coded_i" alt="web browser type,web browser language">web browser type and language</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="access times">access times</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="pages viewed">pages viewed</span>, your <span class="coded_i" alt="ip address">IP address</span>, and the <span class="coded_i" alt="website you visited before navigating to our websites">website you visited before navigating to our websites</span>. If another user allows us to collect <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> from his or her device phonebook, and you're one of that user's contacts, we may combine the <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> we collect from that user's <span class="coded_i" alt="phonebook">phonebook</span> with other <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> we have collected about you. We may also obtain <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> from other sources and combine that with the <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> we collect through Snapchat.</p></div>
	<div id="text20"><p>Usage Information: We collect <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about your <span class="coded_i" alt="activity">activity</span> and the <span class="coded_i" alt="messages">messages</span> you send and receive through our Services. For example, we collect information such as the <span class="coded_i" alt="time">time</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="date">date</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="sender">sender</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="message recipient">recipient of a message</span>, the <span class="coded_i" alt="number of messages you exchange with your friends">number of messages you exchange with your friends</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="friends,message recipients">which friends you exchange messages with the most</span>, and your <span class="coded_i" alt="interactions with messages">interactions with messages</span> (such as when you open a message or capture a screenshot). We may collect that same basic <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> when you use Snapcash, along with the dollar amounts sent and received. Content Information: Please check out the Message Deletion section in this privacy policy; it gives you more information about the message content we collect, how long we keep it, and how long third parties may have access to it.</p></div>
	<div id="text21"><p>We may change this privacy policy from time to time. But when we do, we'll let you know one way or another. Sometimes, we'll let you know by revising the date at the top of the privacy policy that's available on our website. Other times, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websites homepages or sending you a notification). Of course, if you ever have a question about our privacy policy, just visit https://support.snapchat.com. What You Directly Provide Us. For you to create a basic Snapchat account, we need to collect a few important details about you: a <span class="coded_i" alt="unique username">unique username</span> you'd like to go by, a <span class="coded_i" alt="password">password</span>, an <span class="coded_i" alt="email address">email address</span> we can contact you at, a <span class="coded_i" alt="phone number">phone number</span>, and your <span class="coded_i" alt="age,date of birth">age or date of birth</span>.</p></div>
	<div id="text22"><p>We may share <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about you with your consent or at your direction, or as otherwise provided in this privacy policy. We may also share aggregated or <span class="coded_i" alt="de-identified information">de-identified information</span>, which can not reasonably be used to identify you. Here's just one example of how this could work: Because it's not always clear whether a new friend request comes from someone you actually know, we may share whether you and the requestor have Snapchat friends in common without disclosing the <span class="coded_i" alt="usernames">usernames</span> of those common friends. The Services may also contain third-party links or be a co-branded or third-party-branded Service that's being provided jointly with or by another company.</p></div>
	<div id="text23"><p>When other users view your profile, they will be able to <span class="coded_i" alt="view">view</span> <span class="coded_i" alt="profile information">profile information</span>, including your <span class="coded_i" alt="username">username</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="score">score</span> (the total number of messages you have sent and received), a <span class="coded_i" alt="list of the friends you exchange messages with the most">list of the friends you exchange messages with the most</span> (your <span class="coded_i" alt="best friends list">Best Friends list</span>), and, depending on your settings, your <span class="coded_i" alt="name">name</span>. Similarly, your <span class="coded_i" alt="username">username</span> may appear in the Best Friends lists of others. If another user tries to interact with you through a feature that you're unable to use because you're too young, say, for instance, you don't meet the 18 plus age requirement for Snapcash, we may tell the user that you're ineligible to use the feature, so that the user isn't left wondering why you never responded. We may share <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about you with service providers who perform services on our behalf.</p></div>
	<div id="text24"><p>When you send a <span class="coded_i" alt="snap">Snap</span> to an Our Story (or any crowd-sourced Story that may go by a different name), the <span class="coded_i" alt="snap">Snap</span> may be viewed by all Snapchat users and may be publicly distributed outside of Snapchat by us or third parties. Check out our Terms of Use for more information. When you let us access your <span class="coded_i" alt="device phonebook">device phonebook</span>, we may share <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about you with other users who have your <span class="coded_i" alt="phone number">phone number</span> in their <span class="coded_i" alt="device phonebook">device phonebook</span>. For instance, when you use Find Friends, we may share your <span class="coded_i" alt="username">username</span> and <span class="coded_i" alt="name">name</span> with other users who use Find Friends and have your phone number in their <span class="coded_i" alt="device phonebook">device phonebook</span>. In these cases, we will not display your <span class="coded_i" alt="phone number">phone number</span> to these users, but we will share the fact that your <span class="coded_i" alt="username">username</span> and <span class="coded_i" alt="name">name</span> are associated with your <span class="coded_i" alt="phone number">phone number</span>.</p></div>
	<div id="text25"><p>With respect to jointly offered Services or functionality or services offered separately by other companies through our Services, we may share <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about you with business partners to provide the Services and functionality you request and to communicate with you about those Services; We may share <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about you in response to legal process or a request for <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> if we believe disclosure is consistent with, or required by, any applicable law, rule, or regulation; to investigate or remedy potential violations of our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of us, our users, or others; or in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</p></div>
