Behavioural retargeting is another form of OBA which enables us and some of our advertising partners to show you ads based on your online reading away from the Reuters site. For example, if you have visited the website of an online clothing shop you may start seeing ads from that same shopping site displaying special offers or showing you the products that you were browsing. This allows companies to advertise to visitors who are interested in their <span class="coded_i" alt="content">content</span> after they leave their website.</p></div>
	<div id="text5"><p>OBA works by showing you advertisements which are based on the type of <span class="coded_i" alt="content">content</span> you have been reading, and delivering advertisements which we believe may be of interest to you.
