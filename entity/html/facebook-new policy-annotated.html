	<div id="text1"><p>A tag is a special type of link to someone's timeline that suggests that the tagged person add your story to their timeline. In cases where the tagged person isn't included in the audience of the story, it will add them so they can see it. Anyone can tag you in anything. Once you are tagged, you and your friends will be able to see it (such as in News Feed or in search). You can choose whether a story you've been tagged in appears on your timeline. You can either approve each story individually or approve all stories by your friends.</p></div>
	<div id="text2"><p>And communities use Pages to discuss topics of interest, everything from baseball to the opera.Because Pages are public, <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> you share with a <span class="coded_i" alt="page">Page</span> is public information. This means, for example, that if you post a <span class="coded_i" alt="comment">comment</span> on a Page, that <span class="coded_i" alt="comment">comment</span> may be used by the Page owner off Facebook, and anyone can see it. When you 'like' a Page, you create a connection to that Page. The <span class="coded_i" alt="connection">connection</span> is added to your timeline and your friends may see it in their News Feeds. You may be contacted by or receive updates from the Page, such as in your News Feed and your messages.</p></div>
	<div id="text3"><p>Apps you've installed can update their records of your <span class="coded_i" alt="basic info">basic info</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="age range">age range</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="language">language</span> and <span class="coded_i" alt="country">country</span>. If you haven't used an app in a while, you should consider removing it. Once you remove an app, it won't be able to continue to update the additional <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> you've given them permission to access, but it may still hold the <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> you have already shared. You always can contact the app directly and request that they delete your <span class="coded_i" alt="data">data</span>. Learn more at: https://www.facebook.com/help/how-apps-work Sometimes a game console, mobile phone, or other device might ask for permission to share specific information with the games and applications you use on that device.</p></div>
	<div id="text4"><p>But remember that people can still find you or a link to your <span class="coded_i" alt="timeline">timeline</span> on Facebook through other people and the <span class="coded_i" alt="things">things</span> they share about you or through other <span class="coded_i" alt="posts">posts</span>, like if you are tagged in a friend's photo or post something to a public page. Your settings do not control whether people can find you or a link to your <span class="coded_i" alt="timeline">timeline</span> when they search for content they have permission to see, like a <span class="coded_i" alt="tagged photo,tagged story">photo or other story in which you've been tagged</span>. Once you share <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> with your friends and others, they may be able to sync it with or access it via their mobile phones and other devices.</p></div>
	<div id="text5"><p>But these controls do not let you limit access to your <span class="coded_i" alt="public information">public information</span> and <span class="coded_i" alt="friend list">friend list</span>. If you want to completely block applications from getting your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> when your friends and others use them, you will need to turn off all Platform applications. This means that you will no longer be able to use any third-party Facebook-integrated games, applications or websites. If an application asks permission from someone else to access your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span>, the application will be allowed to use that <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> only in connection with the person that gave the permission, and no one else.</p></div>
	<div id="text6"><p>But we only keep it until it is no longer useful to provide you services, like keeping your <span class="coded_i" alt="gps coordinates">last GPS coordinates</span> to send you relevant notifications. We only provide <span class="coded_i" alt="data">data</span> to our advertising partners or customers after we have removed your <span class="coded_i" alt="name">name</span> and any other personally <span class="coded_i" alt="identifying information">identifying information</span> from it, or have combined it with other people's data in a way that it no longer personally identifies you. When we use the phrase '<span class="coded_i" alt="public information">public information</span>' (which we sometimes refer to as '<span class="coded_i" alt="everyone information">Everyone information</span>'), we mean the <span class="coded_i" alt="information you choose to make public">information you choose to make public</span>, as well as <span class="coded_i" alt="information that is always publicly available">information that is always publicly available</span>.</p></div>
	<div id="text7"><p>But we will try to only show it to friends that could benefit from your experience. <span class="coded_i" alt="cookies">Cookies</span> are small pieces of data that are stored on your computer, mobile phone or other device. Pixels are small blocks of code on webpages that do things like allow another server to measure viewing of a webpage and often are used in connection with cookies. We use technologies like <span class="coded_i" alt="cookies">cookies</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="pixels">pixels</span>, and <span class="coded_i" alt="local storage">local storage</span> (like on your browser or device, which is similar to a cookie but holds more <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span>) to provide and understand a range of products and services.</p></div>
	<div id="text8"><p>Choosing to make your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> public is exactly what it sounds like: anyone, including people off Facebook, will be able to see it. Choosing to make your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> public also means that this information: can be associated with you (i.e., your <span class="coded_i" alt="name">name</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="profile pictures">profile pictures</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="cover photos">cover photos</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="timeline">timeline</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="user id">User ID</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="username">username</span>, etc.) even off Facebook; can show up when someone does a search on Facebook or on a public search engine; will be accessible to the Facebook-integrated games, applications, and websites you and your friends use; and will be accessible to anyone who uses our APIs such as our Graph API.</p></div>
	<div id="text9"><p><span class="coded_i" alt="cookies">Cookies</span> and things like <span class="coded_i" alt="local storage">local storage</span> help make Facebook work, like allowing pages to load faster because certain <span class="coded_i" alt="content">content</span> is stored on your browser or by helping us authenticate you to deliver personalized content. To learn more about how advertisers generally use <span class="coded_i" alt="cookies">cookies</span> and the choices advertisers provide, visit the Network Advertising Initiative at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, the Digital Advertising Alliance at http://www.aboutads.info/, the Internet Advertising Bureau (US) at http://www.iab.net or the Internet Advertising Bureau (EU) at http://youronlinechoices.eu/. Refer to your browser or device's help material to learn what controls you can often use to remove or block <span class="coded_i" alt="cookies">cookies</span> or other similar technologies or block or remove other <span class="coded_i" alt="data">data</span> stored on your computer or device (such as by using the various <span class="coded_i" alt="settings">settings</span> in your browser).</p></div>
	<div id="text10"><p>Facebook Platform (or simply Platform) refers to the way we help you share your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> with the games, applications, and websites you and your friends use. Facebook Platform also lets you bring your friends with you, so you can connect with them off Facebook. In these two ways, Facebook Platform helps you make your experiences on the web more personalized and social.Remember that these games, applications and websites are created and maintained by other businesses and developers who are not part of, or controlled by, Facebook, so you should always make sure to read their terms of service and privacy policies to understand how they treat your <span class="coded_i" alt="data">data</span>.</p></div>
	<div id="text11"><p>For example, Apps may have reasons (e.g. legal obligations) to retain some <span class="coded_i" alt="data">data</span> that you share with them. Just like when you share <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> by email or elsewhere on the web, <span class="coded_i" alt="information you share on facebook">information you share on Facebook</span> can be re-shared. This means that if you share something on Facebook, anyone who can see it can share it with others, including the <span class="coded_i" alt="games">games</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="applications">applications</span>, and <span class="coded_i" alt="websites they use">websites they use</span>. Your friends and the other people you share <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> with often want to share your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> with applications to make their experiences on those applications more personalized and social.For example, one of your friends might want to use a music application that allows them to see <span class="coded_i" alt="friend's listening interest">what their friends are listening to</span>.</p></div>
	<div id="text12"><p>For example, if a person 'likes' the 'Star Trek' Page and mentions 'Star Wars' when they check into a movie theater, we may infer that this person is likely to be a sci-fi fan and advertisers of sci-fi movies could ask us to target that category. In addition to delivering relevant ads, Facebook sometimes pairs ads with <span class="coded_i" alt="social context">social context</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="stories">meaning stories about social actions that you or your friends have taken</span>. For example, an ad for a sushi restaurant's Facebook Page may be paired with a <span class="coded_i" alt="news feed story">News Feed story</span> that one of your friends likes that <span class="coded_i" alt="page">Page</span>.</p></div>
	<div id="text13"><p>For example, if the site is a music site, it can access your <span class="coded_i" alt="music interests">music interests</span> to suggest songs you may like, and <span class="coded_i" alt="friends' music interests">access your friends' music interests</span> to let you know what they are listening to. Of course it can only access your or <span class="coded_i" alt="friends' music interests">your friends' music interests</span> if they are public. If the site or app wants any additional <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span>, it will have to get your specific permission. Your public search setting controls whether people who enter your name on a public search engine may see your <span class="coded_i" alt="public timeline">public timeline</span> (including in sponsored results). You can find your public search setting on the 'Privacy Settings and Tools' settings page.</p></div>
	<div id="text14"><p>For example, if you hide your <span class="coded_i" alt="birthday">birthday</span> so no one can see it on your timeline, but friends post 'happy birthday!' on your timeline, people may determine your birthday. When you <span class="coded_i" alt="comment">comment</span> on or 'like' someone else's story, or write on their timeline, that person gets to select the audience. For example, if a friend posts a Public story and you comment on it, your <span class="coded_i" alt="comment">comment</span> will be Public. Often, you can see the audience someone selected for their story before you post a comment; however, the person who posted the story may later change their audience. So, if you comment on a story, and the story's audience changes, the new audience can see your comment.</p></div>
	<div id="text15"><p>For example, if you share a <span class="coded_i" alt="photo">photo</span> on Facebook, someone viewing that photo could save it using Facebook tools or by other methods offered by their device or browser. Similarly, if you share your <span class="coded_i" alt="contact information">contact information</span> with someone or invite someone to an event, they may be able to use Facebook or third party applications or devices to sync that <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span>. Or, if one of your friends has a Facebook application on one of their devices, your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> (such as the <span class="coded_i" alt="posts,photos shared">things you post or photos you share</span>) may be stored on or accessed by their <span class="coded_i" alt="device">device</span>.</p></div>
	<div id="text16"><p>For example, some apps use information such as your <span class="coded_i" alt="friends list">friends list</span>, to personalize your experience or show you which of your friends use that particular app. Facebook Platform lets you log into other applications and websites using your Facebook account. When you log in using Facebook, we give the site your <span class="coded_i" alt="user id">User ID</span> (just like when you connect with any other application), but we do not share your email <span class="coded_i" alt="address">address</span> or password with that website through this process without your permission. If you already have an account on that website, the site may also be able to connect that account with your Facebook account.</p></div>
	<div id="text17"><p>For example, we may get your <span class="coded_i" alt="gps">GPS</span> or other <span class="coded_i" alt="location information">location information</span> so we can tell you if any of your friends are nearby, or we could request <span class="coded_i" alt="device information">device information</span> to improve how our apps work on your device. We receive <span class="coded_i" alt="data">data</span> whenever you visit a game, application, or website that uses Facebook <span class="coded_i" alt="platform">Platform</span> or visit a site with a Facebook feature (such as a <span class="coded_i" alt="social plugin">social plugin</span>), sometimes through cookies. This may include the <span class="coded_i" alt="date you visit,time you visit">date and time you visit</span> the <span class="coded_i" alt="site">site</span>; the <span class="coded_i" alt="web address">web address</span>, or <span class="coded_i" alt="url">URL</span>, you're on; <span class="coded_i" alt="technical information about the ip address">technical information about the IP address</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="browser information,operating system">browser and the operating system you use</span>; and, if you are logged in to Facebook, your <span class="coded_i" alt="user id">User ID</span>.</p></div>
	<div id="text18"><p>For example, we may make friend suggestions, pick stories for your News Feed, or suggest people to tag in photos. We may put together your <span class="coded_i" alt="current city">current city</span> with <span class="coded_i" alt="gps">GPS</span> and other <span class="coded_i" alt="location information">location information</span> we have about you to, for example, tell you and your friends about people or events nearby, or offer deals to you in which you might be interested. We may also put together <span class="coded_i" alt="data">data</span> about you to serve you ads or other content that might be more relevant to you. When we get your <span class="coded_i" alt="gps location">GPS location</span>, we put it together with other <span class="coded_i" alt="location information">location information</span> we have about you (like your <span class="coded_i" alt="current city">current city</span>).</p></div>
	<div id="text19"><p>For example, we may tell an advertiser how its <span class="coded_i" alt="ads">ads</span> perform or how many people viewed or clicked on their ads or install an app after seeing an ad. So we can show you content that you may find interesting, we may use all of the <span class="coded_i" alt="information we receive about you">information we receive about you</span> to serve ads that are more relevant to you. For example, this includes: <span class="coded_i" alt="registration information">information you provide at registration or add to your account or timeline</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="things you share">things you share and do on Facebook</span>, such as <span class="coded_i" alt="likes">what you like</span>, and your <span class="coded_i" alt="interactions with advertisements">interactions with advertisements</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="partners">partners</span>, or <span class="coded_i" alt="apps">apps</span><span class="coded_i" alt="keywords from your stories">,keywords from your storie</span>s,<span class="coded_i" alt="usage information"> andthings we infer from your use of Faceboo</span>k.</p></div>
	<div id="text20"><p>For many ads we serve, advertisers may choose their audience by <span class="coded_i" alt="location">location</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="demographics">demographics</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="likes">likes</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="keywords">keywords</span>, and any other <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> we receive or infer about <span class="coded_i" alt="users">users</span>. Here are some of the ways advertisers may target relevant ads: <span class="coded_i" alt="demographics">demographics</span> and <span class="coded_i" alt="interests">interests</span>: for example, 18 to 35 year-old women who live in the United States and like basketball; <span class="coded_i" alt="topics,keywords">topics or keywords</span>: for example, 'music' or people who like a particular song or <span class="coded_i" alt="artist">artist</span><span class="coded_i" alt="page likes">;Page like</span>s (including topics such as<span class="coded_i" alt="products"> product</span>s,<span class="coded_i" alt="brands"> brand</span>s,<span class="coded_i" alt="religion"> religio</span>n,<span class="coded_i" alt="health status"> health statu</span>s, or<span class="coded_i" alt="political views"> political view</span>s): for example, if you like a<span class="coded_i" alt="page"> Pag</span>e about gluten-free food, you may receive ads about relevant food products; orcategories (including things like 'moviegoer' or a 'sci-fi fan').</p></div>
	<div id="text21"><p><span class="coded_i" alt="gender">Gender</span>: This allows us to refer to you properly. <span class="coded_i" alt="username,user id">Username and User ID</span>: These allow you to give out a custom link to your timeline or Page, receive email at your Facebook <span class="coded_i" alt="email address">email address</span>, and help make Facebook Platform possible. <span class="coded_i" alt="usernames,user ids">Usernames and User IDs</span> are the same thing a way to identify you on Facebook. A <span class="coded_i" alt="user id">User ID</span> is a string of numbers and a <span class="coded_i" alt="username">username</span> generally is some variation of your name. With your <span class="coded_i" alt="username">username</span>, you get a <span class="coded_i" alt="custom link">custom link</span> (a Facebook URL, such as www.facebook.com/username) to your timeline that you can give out to people or post on external websites.</p></div>
	<div id="text22"><p>If an advertiser chooses to run <span class="coded_i" alt="ads">ads</span>, we serve the ads to people who meet criteria the advertiser selects. So, if someone views or otherwise interacts with the ad, the advertiser might assume that the person meets the criteria they selected (for example, that the person is an 18-to-35-year-old woman who lives in the U.S. and likes basketball). We require advertisers to comply with our Advertising Guidelines, including provisions relating to the use of sensitive <span class="coded_i" alt="data">data</span>. Advertisers and their partners sometimes use <span class="coded_i" alt="cookies">cookies</span> or other similar technologies in order to serve and measure ads and to make their ads more effective.</p></div>
	<div id="text23"><p>If someone has your <span class="coded_i" alt="username">Username</span> or <span class="coded_i" alt="user id">User ID</span>, they can use it to access <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about you through the facebook.com website. For example, if someone has your Username, they can type facebook.com/Username into their browser and see your <span class="coded_i" alt="public information">public information</span> as well as anything else you've let them see. Similarly, someone with your Username or User ID can access <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about you through our APIs, such as our Graph API. Specifically, they can access your <span class="coded_i" alt="public information">public information</span>, along with your <span class="coded_i" alt="age range">age range</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="language">language</span> and <span class="coded_i" alt="country">country</span>. If you do not want your information to be accessible to Platform applications, you can turn off all Platform applications from your Privacy Settings.</p></div>
	<div id="text24"><p>If you approve a story and later change your mind, you can always remove it from your timeline. If you do not want someone to tag you, we encourage you to reach out to them and give them that feedback. If that does not work, you can block them. This will prevent them from tagging you going forward. Social reporting is a way for people to quickly and easily ask for help from someone they trust. Similarly, if you are linked to a <span class="coded_i" alt="comment">comment</span>, only the people who can see the <span class="coded_i" alt="comment">comment</span> can see the link. As described in the 'what your friends and others share about you' section of this policy, your friends and others may share <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about you.</p></div>
	<div id="text25"><p>If you do not want us to store this <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span>, visit this help page at: https://www.facebook.com/contact_importer/remove_uploads.php. If you give us your <span class="coded_i" alt="password">password</span>, we will delete it after you upload your <span class="coded_i" alt="friends">friends</span>' <span class="coded_i" alt="contact">contact</span> <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span>. When you invite a friend to join Facebook, we send a message on your behalf using your <span class="coded_i" alt="name">name</span>, and we may also include names and pictures of other people your friend might know on Facebook. We'll also send a few reminders to those you invite, but the invitation will also give your friend the opportunity to opt out of receiving other invitations to join Facebook. We may memorialize the account of a deceased person.</p></div>
	<div id="text26"><p>If you do that, that site or app is required to delete all of the <span class="coded_i" alt="information about you">information about you</span> it received from Facebook as part of the instant personalization program. In addition, we will prevent that site from accessing your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> in the future, even when your friends use that site. If you decide that you do not want to experience instant personalization for all partner sites and apps, you can disable instant personalization from the 'Apps' settings page. If you turn off instant personalization, these partner third party sites and apps will not be able to access your <span class="coded_i" alt="public information">public information</span>, even when your friends visit those sites.</p></div>
	<div id="text27"><p>If you do this, it may affect your ability to use Facebook or other websites and apps. We may send you notifications and other messages using the contact <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> we have for you, like your <span class="coded_i" alt="email address">email address</span>. You can control most of the notifications you receive, including ones from Pages you like and applications you use, using controls we provide, such as a control included in the email you receive or in your 'Notifications' settings. We offer tools to help you upload your <span class="coded_i" alt="friends' contact information">friends' contact information</span> so that you and others can find friends on Facebook, and invite friends who do not use Facebook to join, and so we can offer you and others better experiences on Facebook through suggestions and other customized experiences.</p></div>
	<div id="text28"><p>If you say okay, those applications will not be able to access any other information about you without asking specific permission from you or your friends. Sites and apps that use Instant <span class="coded_i" alt="personalization">Personalization</span> receive your <span class="coded_i" alt="user id">User ID</span> and <span class="coded_i" alt="friend list">friend list</span> when you visit them. You always can remove apps you've installed by using your app settings at: https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=applications. But remember, apps may still be able to access your information when the people you share with use them. And, if you've removed an application and want it to delete the information you've already shared with it, you should contact the application. Visit the application's page on Facebook or its own website to learn more about the app.</p></div>
	<div id="text29"><p>If you turn off Platform you will no longer be able to use any games or other applications until you turn Platform back on. For more information about the <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> that apps receive when you visit them, see Other websites and applications. If you want to see <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> available about you through our Graph API, just type https://graph.facebook.com/[User ID or Username]?metadata=1 into your browser. Your <span class="coded_i" alt="facebook email address">Facebook email address</span> includes your <span class="coded_i" alt="public username">public username</span> like so: username@facebook.com. People can use your <span class="coded_i" alt="facebook email address">Facebook email address</span> to send you messages and anyone in a message conversation can reply to it.</p></div>
	<div id="text30"><p>If you turn off an instant personalization site or app after you have been using it or visited it a few times (or after you have given it specific permission to access your <span class="coded_i" alt="data">data</span>), it will not automatically delete <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about you it received through Facebook. Like all other apps, the site is required by our policies to delete <span class="coded_i" alt="information about you">information about you</span> if you ask it to do so. To join the instant personalization program, a potential partner must enter into an agreement with us designed to protect your privacy. For example, this agreement requires that the partner delete <span class="coded_i" alt="information about you">information about you</span> if you turn off instant personalization when you first visit the site or app.</p></div>
	<div id="text31"><p>If you want to stop using your <span class="coded_i" alt="account">account</span>, you can either deactivate or delete it. Deactivating your <span class="coded_i" alt="account">account</span> puts your account on hold. Other users will no longer see your <span class="coded_i" alt="timeline">timeline</span>, but we do not delete any of your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span>. Deactivating an <span class="coded_i" alt="account">account</span> is the same as you telling us not to delete any <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> because you might want to reactivate your <span class="coded_i" alt="account">account</span> at some point in the future. You can deactivate your <span class="coded_i" alt="account">account</span> at: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=security Your friends will still see you listed in their list of friends while your account is deactivated. When you delete your <span class="coded_i" alt="account">account</span>, it is permanently deleted from Facebook.</p></div>
	<div id="text32"><p>In addition to the <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> we provide in this section, you can also learn more about advertising products, how they work, our partnerships, and the controls you have, by visiting our 'Advertising on Facebook' page. When we deliver ads, we do not share your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> (information that personally identifies you, such as your name or contact information) with advertisers unless you give us permission. We may provide advertisers with <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> when we have removed your <span class="coded_i" alt="name,personally identifying information">name and other personally identifying information</span> from it, or combined it with other <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> so that it no longer personally identifies you.</p></div>
	<div id="text33"><p>It also includes the <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> you choose to share when you communicate with us, such as when you contact us using an <span class="coded_i" alt="email address">email address</span>, or when you take an action, such as <span class="coded_i" alt="friends">when you add a friend</span>, like a <span class="coded_i" alt="page,website">Page or a website</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="place">add a place to your story</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="contact information">use our contact importers</span>, or <span class="coded_i" alt="relationship status">indicate you are in a relationship</span>. Your <span class="coded_i" alt="name">name</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="profile pictures">profile pictures</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="cover photos">cover photos</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="gender">gender</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="networks">networks</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="username">username</span> and <span class="coded_i" alt="user id">User ID</span> are treated just like information you choose to make public. Your <span class="coded_i" alt="birthday">birthday</span> allows us to do things like show you age-appropriate content and advertisements.</p></div>
	<div id="text34"><p>It also prevents the partner from accessing any <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about you until you or your friends visit its site.Instant personalization partners sometimes use an email hash process to see if any of their users are on Facebook and get those users' User IDs. This process is similar to searching for someone on Facebook using an email <span class="coded_i" alt="address">address</span>, except in this case, the email addresses are hashed so no actual email addresses are exchanged.</p></div>
	<div id="text35"><p>It typically takes about one month to delete an account, but some <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> may remain in backup copies and logs for up to 90 days. You should only delete your account if you are sure you never want to reactivate it. You can delete your account at: https://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=delete_account Learn more at: https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=356107851084108 <span class="coded_i" alt="certain information">Certain information</span> is needed to provide you with services, so we only delete this information after you delete your account. Some of the things you do on Facebook aren't stored in your account, like <span class="coded_i" alt="post">posting to a group</span> or <span class="coded_i" alt="message sent">sending someone a message</span> (where your friend may still have a message you sent, even after you delete your account). That information remains after you delete your account.</p></div>
	<div id="text36"><p><span class="coded_i" alt="name">Name</span>: This helps your friends and family find you. If you are uncomfortable sharing your <span class="coded_i" alt="real name">real name</span>, you can always delete your <span class="coded_i" alt="account">account</span>. <span class="coded_i" alt="profile pictures,cover photos">Profile Pictures and Cover Photos</span>: These help your friends and family recognize you. If you are uncomfortable making any of these photos public, you can always delete them. Unless you delete them, when you add a new profile <span class="coded_i" alt="picture">picture</span> or cover <span class="coded_i" alt="photo">photo</span>, the previous photo will remain public in your profile picture or cover photo album. <span class="coded_i" alt="networks">Networks</span>: This helps you see who you will be sharing <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> with before you choose 'Friends and Networks' as a custom audience. If you are uncomfortable making your network public, you can leave the network.</p></div>
	<div id="text37"><p>Similarly, if you use an 'Add To Timeline' <span class="coded_i" alt="plugin">plugin</span>, the plugin will ask for your permission to publish <span class="coded_i" alt="stories about your activities">stories about your activities</span> on that website to Facebook. If you make something public using a <span class="coded_i" alt="plugin">plugin</span>, such as posting a <span class="coded_i" alt="public comment">public comment</span> on a newspaper's website, then that website can access your <span class="coded_i" alt="comment">comment</span> (along with your <span class="coded_i" alt="user id">User ID</span>) just like everyone else. If you post something using a social <span class="coded_i" alt="plugin">plugin</span> and you do not see a sharing icon, you should assume that story is Public. For example, if you post a <span class="coded_i" alt="comment">comment</span> through a Facebook comment plugin on a site, your story is Public and everyone, including the website, can see your story.</p></div>
	<div id="text38"><p>Social plugins are buttons, boxes, and stories (such as the Like button) that other websites can use to present Facebook content to you and create more social and personal experiences for you. While you view these buttons, boxes, and stories on other sites, the content comes directly from Facebook. Sometimes plugins act just like applications. You can spot one of these plugins because it will ask you for permission to access your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> or to publish information back to Facebook. For example, if you use a registration <span class="coded_i" alt="plugin">plugin</span> on a website, the plugin will ask your permission to share your <span class="coded_i" alt="basic info">basic info</span> with the website to make it easier for you to register for the website.</p></div>
	<div id="text39"><p>Sometimes it does this using what is called an 'email hash', which is similar to searching for someone on Facebook using an email address. Only the <span class="coded_i" alt="email addresses">email addresses</span> in this case are hashed so no email addresses are actually shared between Facebook and the website. The website sends over a hashed version of your <span class="coded_i" alt="email address">email address</span>, and we match it with a database of email addresses that we have also hashed. If there is a match, then we tell the website the <span class="coded_i" alt="user id">User ID</span> associated with the email address. This way, when you log into the website using Facebook, the website can link your Facebook account to your account on that website.</p></div>
	<div id="text40"><p>Sometimes we get <span class="coded_i" alt="data">data</span> from our affiliates or our advertising partners, customers and other third parties that helps us (or them) deliver ads, understand online activity, and generally make Facebook better. For example, an advertiser may tell us <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about you (like <span class="coded_i" alt="how you responded to an ad on facebook or on another site">how you responded to an ad on Facebook or on another site</span>) in order to measure the effectiveness of - and improve the quality of - ads. As described in 'How we use the <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> we receive' we also put together <span class="coded_i" alt="data">data</span> from the <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> we already have about you, your friends, and others, so we can offer and suggest a variety of services and features.</p></div>
	<div id="text41"><p>Sometimes you will not be able to select an audience when you post something (like when you <span class="coded_i" alt="comment">write on a Page's wall or comment</span> on a news article that uses our comments <span class="coded_i" alt="plugin">plugin</span>). This is because some types of <span class="coded_i" alt="stories">stories</span> are always <span class="coded_i" alt="public stories">public stories</span>. As a general rule, you should assume that if you do not see a sharing icon, the <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> will be publicly available. When others share <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about you, they can also choose to make it public. The types of <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> listed below are always publicly available, and they are treated just like <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> you decided to make public.</p></div>
	<div id="text42"><p>The partner is also contractually required not to use your <span class="coded_i" alt="user id">User ID</span> for any purpose (other than associating it with your account) until you or your friends visit the site.When you visit a site or app using instant personalization, we provide the site or app with your <span class="coded_i" alt="user id">User ID</span> and your <span class="coded_i" alt="friend list">friend list</span> (as well as your <span class="coded_i" alt="age range">age range</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="locale">locale</span>, and <span class="coded_i" alt="gender">gender</span>). The site or app can then connect your <span class="coded_i" alt="account">account</span> with your friends' accounts to make the site or app instantly social. The site can also access <span class="coded_i" alt="public information associated with any of the user ids it receives">public information associated with any of the User IDs it receives</span>, which it can use to make them instantly personalized.</p></div>
	<div id="text43"><p>They may share <span class="coded_i" alt="photos">photos</span> or other <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about you and tag you in their posts.If you do not like a particular post, tell them or report the post. Once you are in a Group, anyone in that Group can add you to a subgroup. When someone adds you to a Group, you will be listed as 'invited' until you visit the Group. You can always leave a Group, which will prevent others from adding you to it again. Facebook Pages are public pages. Companies use Pages to share <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about their products. Celebrities use Pages to talk about their latest projects.</p></div>
	<div id="text44"><p>This means that the <span class="coded_i" alt="story">story</span> may be visible elsewhere, like in your friends' News Feed. If you want to delete a <span class="coded_i" alt="story">story</span> you posted, choose the delete option. Anyone can add a link to a story. Links are references to something on the Internet; anything from a website to a Page or timeline on Facebook. For example, if you are writing a story, you might include a link to a blog you are referencing or a link to the blogger's Facebook timeline. If someone clicks on a link to another person's timeline, they'll only see the things that they are allowed to see.</p></div>
	<div id="text45"><p>This setting does not apply to search engines that access your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> as an application using Facebook Platform. If you turn your public search setting off and then search for yourself on a public search engine, you may still see a preview of your <span class="coded_i" alt="timeline">timeline</span>. This is because some search engines <span class="coded_i" alt="cache">cache</span> <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> for a period of time. You can learn more about how to request a search engine to remove you from cached <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> at: https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=13323IV. Facebook offers a range of products that allow advertisers to reach people on and off Facebook.</p></div>
	<div id="text46"><p>To do this, simply click on the sharing icon and choose who can see it. Choose this icon if you want to make something Public. Choosing to make something public is exactly what it sounds like. It means that anyone, including people off Facebook, will be able to see or access it. Choose this icon if you want to share with your Facebook Friends. Choose this icon if you want to Customize your audience. You can also use this to hide the <span class="coded_i" alt="item on your timeline">item on your timeline</span> from specific people.When you select an audience for your friend list, you are only controlling who can see the entire list of your friends on your <span class="coded_i" alt="timeline">timeline</span>.</p></div>
	<div id="text47"><p>To get the full benefit of that application, your friend would want to give the application her <span class="coded_i" alt="friend list">friend list </span>' which includes your U<span class="coded_i" alt="user">ser </span>ID ' so the application knows which of her friends is also using it. Your friend might also want to share the <span class="coded_i" alt="music you 'like">music you 'like</span>' on Facebook. If you have made that <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> public, then the application can access it just like anyone else. But if you've shared your <span class="coded_i" alt="likes">likes</span> with just your friends, the application could ask your friend for permission to share them. You can control most of the <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> other people can share with applications they use from the 'App' settings page.</p></div>
	<div id="text48"><p>To make it easier for your friends to find you, we allow anyone with your <span class="coded_i" alt="contact information">contact information</span> (such as email address or telephone number) to find you through the Facebook search bar at the top of most pages, as well as other tools we provide, such as contact importers - even if you have not shared your <span class="coded_i" alt="contact information">contact information</span> with them on Facebook. You can choose who can look up your timeline using the <span class="coded_i" alt="email address">email address</span> or <span class="coded_i" alt="telephone number">telephone number</span> you added to your timeline through your Privacy Settings.</p></div>
	<div id="text49"><p>To make suggestions to you and other users on Facebook, such as: suggesting that your friend use our contact importer because you found friends using it, suggesting that another user add you as a friend because the user imported the same <span class="coded_i" alt="email address">email address</span> as you did, or suggesting that your friend tag you in a <span class="coded_i" alt="picture">picture</span> they have uploaded with you in it; and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement. Granting us permission to <span class="coded_i" alt="use">use</span> your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> not only allows us to provide Facebook as it exists today, but it also allows us to provide you with innovative features and services we develop in the future that use the <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> we receive about you in new ways.</p></div>
	<div id="text50"><p>Typically, <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> associated with your <span class="coded_i" alt="account">account</span> will be kept until your account is deleted. For certain categories of data, we may also tell you about specific data retention practices. We may enable access to <span class="coded_i" alt="public information">public information</span> that has been shared through our services. We may allow service providers to access <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> so they can help us provide services. We are able to suggest that your friend <span class="coded_i" alt="tag">tag</span> you in a picture by scanning and comparing your friend's pictures to <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> we've put together from your <span class="coded_i" alt="profile">profile</span> <span class="coded_i" alt="pictures">pictures</span> and the other photos in which you've been <span class="coded_i" alt="tagged">tagged</span>. If this feature is enabled for you, you can control whether we suggest that another user tag you in a photo using the 'Timeline and Tagging' settings.</p></div>
	<div id="text51"><p>We also sometimes serve these same types of ads on other sites or may serve just the social context (such as with ads served by others), so that the ads are more relevant to you. Just like any other content you share on <span class="coded_i" alt="facebook">Facebook</span>, only people who you're already sharing with on Facebook would see it when it is paired with an ad. We also allow advertisers to reach people on Facebook using the <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> they already have about you (such as <span class="coded_i" alt="email addresses,website visit information">email addresses or whether you have visited their websites previously</span>). You can learn more about ads, social context, and our partnerships, including the relevant settings and controls available to you, by visiting the Advertising on Facebook page.</p></div>
	<div id="text52"><p>We and our affiliates may use shared <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> to help provide, understand, and improve our services and their own services. We give your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> to the people and companies that help us provide, understand and improve the services we offer. For example, we may use outside vendors to help host our website, serve photos and videos, process payments, analyze data, conduct and publish research, measure the effectiveness of ads, or provide search results.In some cases we provide the service jointly with another company, such as the Facebook Marketplace. In all of these cases our partners must agree to only use your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> consistent with the agreement we enter into with them, as well as this Data Use Policy.</p></div>
	<div id="text53"><p>We call this a timeline visibility control. This is because your <span class="coded_i" alt="friend list">friend list</span> is always available to the games, applications and websites you use, and your <span class="coded_i" alt="friendships">friendships</span> may be visible elsewhere (such as on your friends' timelines or in searches). For example, if you select 'Only Me' as the audience for your friend list, but your friend sets her friend list to 'Public,' anyone will be able to see your connection on your friend's timeline. Similarly, if you choose to hide your gender, it only hides it on your timeline. This is because we, just like the applications you and your friends use, need to use your <span class="coded_i" alt="gender">gender</span> to refer to you properly on the site.</p></div>
	<div id="text54"><p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to computers, mobile phones or other devices, which may use a <span class="coded_i" alt="cookie">cookie</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="pixel">pixel</span> or other similar technology placed by Facebook or the third party (although we would not share <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> that personally identifies you with an advertiser). Most companies on the web use <span class="coded_i" alt="cookies">cookies</span> (or other similar technological tools), including our advertising and Platform partners. For example, our Platform partners, advertisers or Page administrators may use <span class="coded_i" alt="cookies">cookies or similar technologies</span> when you access their <span class="coded_i" alt="apps">apps</span>, ads, Pages or other content.</p></div>
	<div id="text55"><p>We receive <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about you from your friends and others, such as <span class="coded_i" alt="contact information">when they upload your contact information</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="personal photo">post a photo of you</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="tagged photo,status update">tag you in a photo or status update</span>, or at a <span class="coded_i" alt="location">location</span>, or <span class="coded_i" alt="group membership">add you to a group</span>. When people use Facebook, they may store and share <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about you and others that they have, such as <span class="coded_i" alt="invites,contacts">when they upload and manage their invites and contacts</span>. We receive <span class="coded_i" alt="data">data</span> about you whenever you use or are running Facebook, such as <span class="coded_i" alt="pages viewed">when you look at another person's timeline</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="message sent,message received">send or receive a message</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="search for a friend or a page">search for a friend or a Page</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="clicks">click on</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="usage information">view or otherwise interact with things</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="facebook app usage information">use a Facebook mobile app</span>, or <span class="coded_i" alt="purchase information">make purchases through Facebook</span>.</p></div>
	<div id="text56"><p>We use the <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> we receive about you in connection with the services and features we provide to you and other users like your friends, our partners, the advertisers that purchase ads on the site, and the developers that build the games, applications, and websites you use. For example, in addition to helping people see and find things that you do and share, we may use the <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> we receive about you: as part of our efforts to keep Facebook products, services and integrations safe and secure; to protect Facebook's or others' rights or property; to provide you with location features and services, like telling you and your friends when something is going on nearby; to measure or understand the effectiveness of ads you and others see, including to deliver relevant ads to you.</p></div>
	<div id="text57"><p>Websites that use <span class="coded_i" alt="social plugins">social plugins</span> can sometimes tell that you have engaged with the social plugin. For example, they may know that you clicked on a Like button in a social plugin. We receive <span class="coded_i" alt="data">data</span> when you visit a site with a social plugin. We keep this data for a maximum of 90 days. After that, we remove your <span class="coded_i" alt="name">name</span> and any other <span class="coded_i" alt="personally identifying information">personally identifying information</span> from the data, or combine it with other people's data in a way that it is no longer associated with you. Instant personalization (sometimes also referred to as 'Start now') is a way for Facebook to help partners (such as Bing and Rotten Tomatoes) on and off Facebook to create a more personalized and social experience for logged in users than a social plugin can offer.</p></div>
	<div id="text58"><p>When someone tags you in a story (such as a <span class="coded_i" alt="photo">photo</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="status update">status update</span> or <span class="coded_i" alt="check-in">check-in</span>), you can choose whether you want that <span class="coded_i" alt="story">story</span> to appear on your timeline. You can either approve each story individually or approve all stories by your friends. If you approve a story and later change your mind, you can remove it from your timeline. When you hide things on your timeline, like posts or connections, it means those things will not appear on your timeline. But, remember, anyone in the audience of those posts or who can see a connection may still see it elsewhere, like on someone else's timeline or in search results.</p></div>
	<div id="text59"><p>When we memorialize an account, we keep the <span class="coded_i" alt="timeline">timeline</span> on Facebook, but limit access and some features. You can report a deceased <span class="coded_i" alt="person's timeline">person's timeline</span> at: https://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=deceased. We also may close an account if we receive a formal request that satisfies certain criteria. We may share <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> we receive with businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies that Facebook is part of, or that become part of that group (often these companies are called affiliates). Likewise, our affiliates may share <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> with us as well. This sharing is done in compliance with applicable laws including where such applicable laws require consent.</p></div>
	<div id="text60"><p>When you connect with a game, application or website - such as by going to a game, logging in to a website using your Facebook <span class="coded_i" alt="account">account</span>, or adding an app to your timeline - we give the <span class="coded_i" alt="game">game</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="application">application</span>, or <span class="coded_i" alt="website">website</span> (sometimes referred to as just 'applications' or 'apps') your <span class="coded_i" alt="basic info">basic info</span> (we sometimes call this your 'public profile'), which includes your <span class="coded_i" alt="user id">User ID</span> and your <span class="coded_i" alt="public information">public information</span>. We also give them your <span class="coded_i" alt="friends' user ids">friends' User IDs</span> (also called your friend list) as part of your <span class="coded_i" alt="basic info">basic info</span>. Your friend list helps the application make your experience more social because it lets you find your friends on that application.</p></div>
	<div id="text61"><p>When you post a <span class="coded_i" alt="story">story</span> on Facebook and an advertiser sponsors it, nothing changes about the audience of the post. Only the people who could originally see the post (the people you shared it with) are eligible to see it. We like to tell you about some of the features and tools your friends and others <span class="coded_i" alt="use">use</span> on Facebook, to help you have a better experience. For example, if your friend <span class="coded_i" alt="uses">uses</span> our <span class="coded_i" alt="friend finder">friend finder</span> <span class="coded_i" alt="tool">tool</span> to find more friends on Facebook, we may tell you about it to encourage you to <span class="coded_i" alt="use">use</span> it as well. This of course means your friend may similarly see suggestions based on the things you do.</p></div>
	<div id="text62"><p>When you post things like photos or videos on Facebook, we may receive additional <span class="coded_i" alt="related data">related data</span> (or metadata), such as the time, date, and place you took the photo or video. We receive <span class="coded_i" alt="computer data">data from or about the computer</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="mobile phone">mobile phone</span>, or other <span class="coded_i" alt="devices you use to install facebook apps or to access facebook">devices you use to install Facebook apps or to access Facebook</span>, including when multiple users log in from the same device.

	<div id="text63"><p>When you visit a site or app using instant personalization, it will know some <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about you and your friends the moment you arrive. This is because sites and apps using instant personalization can access your <span class="coded_i" alt="user id">User ID</span>, your <span class="coded_i" alt="friend list">friend list</span>, and your <span class="coded_i" alt="public information">public information</span>. The first time you visit a site or app using instant personalization, you will see a notification letting you know that the site or app has partnered with Facebook to provide a personalized experience. The notification will give you the ability to disable or turn off instant personalization for that site or app.</p></div>
	<div id="text64"><p>Whenever you post <span class="coded_i" alt="content">content</span> (like a status update, photo or check-in), you can select a specific audience, or even customize your audience. To do this, simply click on the sharing icon and choose who can see it. Choose this icon if you want to make something Public. Choosing to make something public is exactly what it sounds like. It means that anyone, including people off Facebook, will be able to see or access it. Choose this icon if you want to share with your Facebook Friends. Choose this icon if you want to Customize your audience.</p></div>
	<div id="text65"><p>While you are allowing us to <span class="coded_i" alt="use">use</span> the <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> we receive about you, you always own all of your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span>. Your trust is important to us, which is why we don't share <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> we receive about you with others unless we have: received your permission; given you notice, such as by telling you about it in this policy; or removed your <span class="coded_i" alt="name">name</span> and any other <span class="coded_i" alt="personally identifying information">personally identifying information</span> from it. Of course, for <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> others share about you, they control how it is shared. We store <span class="coded_i" alt="data">data</span> for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you and others, including those described above.</p></div>
	<div id="text66"><p>You can also delete your <span class="coded_i" alt="posts">posts</span> or change the audience of content you <span class="coded_i" alt="post">post</span>, which means you can remove people from or add people to the audience of the content. People on Facebook may be able to see <span class="coded_i" alt="mutual friends">mutual friends</span>, even if they cannot see your entire list of friends. Some things (like your <span class="coded_i" alt="name">name</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="profile pictures,cover photos">profile pictures and cover photos</span>) do not have sharing icons because they are always publicly available. As a general rule, you should assume that if you do not see a sharing icon, the <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> will be publicly available.</p></div>
	<div id="text67"><p>You can also remove applications you no longer want, or turn off all Platform applications. When you turn all Platform applications off, your <span class="coded_i" alt="user id">User ID</span> is no longer given to applications, even when your friends use those applications. But you will no longer be able to use any games, applications or websites through Facebook. When you first visit an app, Facebook lets the app know your <span class="coded_i" alt="language">language</span>, your <span class="coded_i" alt="country">country</span>, and whether you <span class="coded_i" alt="age group">are in an age group</span>, for instance, under 18, between 18-20, or 21 and over. <span class="coded_i" alt="age range">Age range</span> lets apps provide you with age-appropriate content. If you install the app, it can access, store and update the <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> you've shared.</p></div>
	<div id="text68"><p>You can also use this to hide your <span class="coded_i" alt="story">story</span> from specific people. If you tag someone, that person and their friends can see your <span class="coded_i" alt="story">story</span> no matter what audience you selected. The same is true when you approve a tag someone else adds to your story. Always think before you post. Just like anything else you post on the web or send in an email, information you share on Facebook can be copied or re-shared by anyone who can see it. Although you choose with whom you share, there may be ways for others to determine <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about you.</p></div>
	<div id="text69"><p>You can control who can see the <span class="coded_i" alt="facebook pages you've 'liked">Facebook Pages you've 'liked</span>' by visiting your <span class="coded_i" alt="timeline">timeline</span>, clicking on the Likes box on your timeline, and then clicking 'Edit.' Sometimes you will not see a sharing icon when you post something (like when you write on a Page's wall or comment on a news article that uses our comments plugin). This is because some types of stories are always public stories. As a general rule, you should assume that if you do not see a sharing icon, the <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> will be publicly available. Whenever you add things to your timeline you can select a specific audience, or even customize your audience.</p></div>
	<div id="text70"><p>You can remove the <span class="coded_i" alt="pages">Pages</span> you've 'liked' through your timeline or on the Page. Some Pages contain content that comes directly from the Page owner. Page owners can do this through online plugins, such as an iframe, and it works just like the games and other applications you use through Facebook. Because this content comes directly from the Page owner, that Page may be able to collect <span class="coded_i" alt="information about you">information about you</span>, just like any website. Page administrators may have access to <span class="coded_i" alt="insights data">insights data</span>, which will tell them generally about the people that visit their Page (as opposed to <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> about specific people). They may also know when you've made a connection to their <span class="coded_i" alt="page">Page</span> because you've liked their Page or posted a comment.</p></div>
	<div id="text71"><p>You should only share information with people you trust because they will be able to save it or re-share it with others, including when they sync the information to a device. Your <span class="coded_i" alt="activity log">activity log</span> is a place where you can go to view most of your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> on Facebook, including things you've hidden from your timeline. You can use this log to manage your <span class="coded_i" alt="content">content</span>. For example, you can do things like delete <span class="coded_i" alt="stories">stories</span>, change the audience of your <span class="coded_i" alt="stories">stories</span> or stop an application from publishing to your timeline on your behalf. When you hide something from your timeline, you are not deleting it.</p></div>
	<div id="text72"><p>Your <span class="coded_i" alt="user id">User ID</span> helps the application personalize your experience because it can connect your account on that application with your Facebook account, and it can access your <span class="coded_i" alt="basic info">basic info</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="public information,friend list">which includes your public information and friend list</span>. This includes the <span class="coded_i" alt="information you choose to make public">information you choose to make public</span>, as well as <span class="coded_i" alt="information that is always publicly available">information that is always publicly available</span>. If the application needs additional information, such as your stories, photos or likes, it will have to ask you for specific permission. The 'Apps' setting lets you control the applications you use. You can see the permissions you have given these applications, the last time an application accessed your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span>, and the audience on Facebook for timeline stories and activity the application posts on your behalf.</p></div>
	<div id="text73"><p>Your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> is the <span class="coded_i" alt="information that's required when you sign up for the site">information that's required when you sign up for the site</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="shared information">as well as the information you choose to share</span>.

In some cases, you may be able to register using other <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span>, like your <span class="coded_i" alt="telephone number">telephone number</span>. Your <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> also includes the <span class="coded_i" alt="information you choose to share on facebook">information you choose to share on Facebook</span>, such as when you post a <span class="coded_i" alt="status update">status update</span>, <span class="coded_i" alt="photo">upload a photo</span>, or <span class="coded_i" alt="comment on a friend's story">comment on a friend's story</span>.</p></div>
