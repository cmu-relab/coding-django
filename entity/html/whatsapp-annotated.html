	<div id="text1"><p>And always, think of the children! The WhatsApp Site and Service are hosted in the United States and are intended for and directed to users in the United States. If you are a user accessing the WhatsApp Site and Service from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing <span class="coded_i" alt="personal data">personal data</span> <span class="coded_i" alt="collection">collection</span>, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the WhatsApp Site and Service, which are governed by California law, this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Service, you are transferring your <span class="coded_i" alt="personal information">personal information</span> to the United States and you expressly consent to that transfer and consent to be governed by California law for these purposes.</p></div>
	<div id="text2"><p>Cookies Information: When you visit the WhatsApp Site, we may send one or more <span class="coded_i" alt="cookies">cookies</span> - a small <span class="coded_i" alt="text file">text file</span> containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your <span class="coded_i" alt="browser">browser</span>. WhatsApp uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent <span class="coded_i" alt="cookie">cookie</span> remains after you close your browser. Persistent <span class="coded_i" alt="cookies">cookies</span> may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent <span class="coded_i" alt="cookies">cookies</span> can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session <span class="coded_i" alt="cookie">cookie</span> is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, the WhatsApp Site may not function properly if the ability to accept <span class="coded_i" alt="cookies">cookies</span> is disabled.</p></div>
	<div id="text3"><p>For example, a status of 'Can't talk, please SMS instead' set by phone number + 1 (408) 555 - 1212 will be available to every user of the WhatsApp Service who has that <span class="coded_i" alt="mobile phone number">mobile phone number</span> in their mobile phone' s <span class="coded_i" alt="address book">address book</span> or <span class="coded_i" alt="contact list">contact list</span>. In other words: If another user has your mobile phone number stored in their mobile phone address book or contact list, they will be able see your status <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> unless you have chosen to block such user. Last Seen <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> is available and displayed to each user who has your <span class="coded_i" alt="mobile phone number">mobile phone number</span> in their mobile phone <span class="coded_i" alt="address book">address book</span> or <span class="coded_i" alt="contact book">contact book</span> (and which you have not blocked), and reflects the last approximate time the WhatsApp mobile application has been used or brought to the foreground on your mobile phone.</p></div>
	<div id="text4"><p>Hopefully we improve the WhatsApp Site and Service and don't make it suck worse. We may use <span class="coded_i" alt="cookies">cookies</span> and <span class="coded_i" alt="log file information">log file information</span> to: (a) remember <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you use the WhatsApp Service or WhatsApp Site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor individual and aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (d) track your entries, submissions, views and such. Other users of the WhatsApp Service may see your Status Submissions in a way that is consistent with the use of the WhatsApp Service.</p></div>
	<div id="text5"><p>In particular, your <span class="coded_i" alt="mobile phone number">mobile phone number</span> is essential to your use of the WhatsApp Service and will be retained. Any <span class="coded_i" alt="billing information">billing information</span> that may be collected from you will be deleted thirty (30) days after the termination of your account with WhatsApp. Any <span class="coded_i" alt="personally identifiable information">Personally Identifiable Information</span> or status <span class="coded_i" alt="content">content</span> that you voluntarily disclose on the WhatsApp Service becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by other users of the WhatsApp Service (unless such user is blocked by you). Your <span class="coded_i" alt="name">name</span> (as it is saved in other user's mobile phone <span class="coded_i" alt="address book">address book</span> or <span class="coded_i" alt="contact list">contact list</span>) may be displayed to other users when you update your status <span class="coded_i" alt="messages">messages</span> through the WhatsApp Service and other users may contact you through the WhatsApp Service.</p></div>
	<div id="text6"><p>In the event that WhatsApp is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the <span class="coded_i" alt="information">information</span> we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the (hopefully) unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your <span class="coded_i" alt="personal information">personal information</span> is treated, transferred, or used.

If you submit <span class="coded_i" alt="personally identifiable information">Personally Identifiable Information</span> to us through the WhatsApp Site, or WhatsApp Service, then we use your <span class="coded_i" alt="personal information">personal information</span> to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the WhatsApp Site and WhatsApp Service.</p></div>
	<div id="text10"><p>Please contact WhatsApp via email to support at whatsapp.com or available web forms with any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, your <span class="coded_i" alt="personal information">personal information</span>, your consent, or your opt-in or opt-out choices.

	<div id="text12"><p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.

If you are under 16 years of age, then please do not use the WhatsApp Service or access the WhatsApp Site at any time or in any manner. If WhatsApp learns that <span class="coded_i" alt="personally identifiable information">Personally Identifiable Information</span> of persons under 16 years of age has been collected on the WhatsApp Site or WhatsApp Service, then WhatsApp may deactivate the account and/or make the status submissions inaccessible.</p></div>

The contents of <span class="coded_i" alt="messages">messages</span> that have been delivered by the WhatsApp Service are not copied, kept or archived by WhatsApp in the normal course of business.

	<div id="text14"><p>Users type their <span class="coded_i" alt="messages">messages</span>, which are sent via data service to our servers, and routed to the intended recipient (who must also be a WhatsApp user), if that recipient is online. If the recipient is not online, the undelivered <span class="coded_i" alt="message">message</span> is held in WhatsApp's server until it can be delivered. If the <span class="coded_i" alt="message">message</span> is undelivered for thirty (30) days, the undelivered <span class="coded_i" alt="message">message</span> is deleted from our servers. Once a <span class="coded_i" alt="message">message</span> has been delivered, it no longer resides on our servers. The contents of any delivered <span class="coded_i" alt="messages">messages</span> are not kept or retained by WhatsApp, the only records of the content of any delivered <span class="coded_i" alt="messages">messages</span> reside directly on the sender's and recipient's mobile devices (and which may be deleted at the user's option).</p></div>
	<div id="text15"><p>Using unsecured wifi or other unprotected networks to submit messages through the WhatsApp Service is never recommended.
